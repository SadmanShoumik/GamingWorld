## An online store for gaming accessories

A simple project created to host an online shop for selling gaming accessories. New users may register on the site.

Upon registration a confiration code will be sent to their email to ensure proper authentication of new users. After confirmation of the email ID, the user can then login to the website.

The user upon login will have multiple functionalities such as searing for products, adding or removing products from the cart, checking out, as well as editing user profile for further convenience.

The project was mainly built upon PHP as the backbone, with HTML, CSS & Bootstrap serving as the frontend of the website.
